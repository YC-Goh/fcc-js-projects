# freeCodeCamp JavaScript/Front-End Development Libraries Projects for Certification

## What?

The third course in sequence on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) (hereafter FCC) focuses on a handful of major front-end development libraries.
To certify that the learner has a basic grasp of the libraries (namely, Bootstrap, jQuery.js, SCSS, React.js, and Redux.js), a series of five certification projects has to be completed.

However, the projects are not to be completed and stored on FCC servers and are instead to be completed locally by the learner.
Completed projects are then to be uploaded to some public repository and the link submitted to FCC for automated testing.
This serves as that repository for my five projects for the FCC Front-End Development Libraries certification.
